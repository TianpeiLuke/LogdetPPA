# LogdetPPA

The _log-determinant primal proxmial point algorithm (__LogdetPPA__)_ is introduced by Wang etal in 

> Wang, Chengjing, Defeng Sun, and Kim-Chuan Toh. "Solving log-determinant optimization problems by a Newton-CG primal proximal point algorithm." SIAM Journal on Optimization 20, no. 6 (2010): 2994-3013.

This project implements the LogdetPPA algorithm in Python. The matlab version written by Kim-Chuan Toh et al is included for self-contained purpose. 

__For anyone using the Matlab version of LogdetPPA, please cite the paper as above.__ 

The __LogdetPPA__ is an efficient solver for Gaussian graphical model selection, __inverse covariance estimation__ and other graphical model inference using Gaussian distribution.
